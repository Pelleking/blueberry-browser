# Blueberry Browser

You are the CTO of Blueberry Browser, a Strawberry competitor. Your mission is to add a feature to Blueberry that makes superior & more promising than Strawberry.

But, your time is limited, Strawberry is about to raise a two billion dollar series A round from X-Separator, B17Ã… and Sequoiadendron giganteum Capital.

## Task

Your job is to clone this repo and add an unique feature. Some ideas will be listed below.

It doesn't need to work 100% reliably, or even be completely done, it just has to:

- show that you are creative and can iterate on novel ideas fast
- have good system thinking and code practices
- are a capable full stack and/or llm dev

Once you are done, we'll book a call where you'll get to present your work!

If it's cracked, we might just have to aquire Blueberry browser to stay alive ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€

### Time

1-2 weeks is ideal for this challenge. This allows you to work over weekends and during evenings in your own time.


### Rules

You are allow vibe code, but make sure you understand everything so we can ask technical questions.


### Ideas

**Browsing History Compiler**

Track the things that the user is doing inside the browser and figure out from a series of browser states what the user is doing, and perhaps how valuable, repetitive tasks can be re-ran by and AI agent.

Tab state series -> Prompt for web agent how to reproduce the work

**Coding Agent**

Sidebar coding agent that can create a script that can run on the open tabs.

Maybe useful for filling forms or changing the page's style so it can 


**Your Own Idea**

If you already worked on something interesting that you'd like to implement. 

Or if you just have a cooler idea than the ones above. Make sure you can realistically showcase a simple version of it in the timeframe.


### Tips

Feel free to write to us with questions or send updates during the process â€“ it's a good way to get a feel for working together.

It can also be a good way for us to give feedback if things are heading in the right or wrong direction.


## Project Setup

### Install

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
$ pnpm dev
```

Add an openAI API key to .env

Strawberry will reimburse LLM costs, so go crazy! (Plz not more than a few hundred dollars though!)
